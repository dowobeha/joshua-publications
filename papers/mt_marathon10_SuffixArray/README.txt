This package contains both the class/package/bibstyle files and samples
in the same directory. Put them to the directory of your article.
Follow the instructions in the sample files.

Remember that functionality of this package is slightly limited. Since
it is intended for those who are not able to install software, it makes
use of the default fonts. It is supposed that you are not able to install
fonts Minion Pro and DejaVu which will be used in the journal version.
