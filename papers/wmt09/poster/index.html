<h1>Cambridge University LaTeX poster style file</h1>

This page gives a brief summary of a latex style file, cuposter.cls,
for creating conference posters in latex.  It is based on a style file
from the University of Edinburgh, with a simple change of logo.  This
style file allows you to create an A0 (or smaller) poster in
encapsulated PostScript format.  I include a sample poster here; you
should be able to regenerate the A4 poster by simply typing
<p>
% make
<p>

If there are no mistakes in the latex, an <a href="a4poster.eps">A4
poster</a> should be created.  This version can be printed out on A4
paper.
<p>
Once happy with your final version of the poster, you can then create
an <a href="a0poster.eps">A0 poster</a> using the command:
<p>
% make scalea0
<p>

Read the <a href="Makefile">Makefile</a> for ways to change filenames,
and create other sizes of poster (it currently can make A0, A1, A2,
A3, A4).  Note that I have hardcoded the use of Times font in the
header.  (That should probably be changed to something like
Helvetica...)


<p>
The default orientation for posters is landscape; passing the option
"portrait" to the documentclass (see the example file) will create
portrait posters.

<h2>Download</h2>
All of the files in this directory (including figures) are available
in the compressed tar file: <a href="cuposter.tgz">cuposter.tgz</a>


<h2>Where to print your document?</h2>

The A1 version prints successfully on the
<a href="http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/Computing/poster_printer.html">DPMMS
A1 printer</a>, although the paper size is not recognised by
Ghostscript, so you need to type in the size of the paper (details to
follow).

<p>
There is no A0 printer within the CMS.  Graduate students within DAMTP
should be able to get a purchase order for their A0 poster to be
printed in somewhere like Pandis or Anatomy.  Engineering also have
an <a
href="http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/oper/help/printing.html">A0
printer</a> but I've yet to be able to test it.  If someone is willing
to test it, let me (sje30 at cam) know.
